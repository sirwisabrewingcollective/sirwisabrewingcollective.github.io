Starting Jan 1st 2014, Business and Professions Code section 23356.2 was amended to allow home wine and beer makes to donate and pour beverages for charity events. 

We wrote a set of instructions for setup charity events which have homebrewed and home made wine. This guide covers permitting, legal requirements, and other recommendations.
