Since 1970, the SF Tenants Union has been fighting for the rights of tenants and for the preservation of affordable housing in San Francisco. Come support this organization which provides free tenant counseling.

This year's event is an Am-Pro collaberation with some of the best Bay Area homebrewers pairing up with Local Brew Masters.  Each homebrewer will host a commercial brewer and brew a collaberative small batch beer. Recipe development, sourcing the ingredients, and the brewing process will all be completed by these Am-Pro teams. The final beers will be available only at Hops for Housing.  

*Music*: Music will be provided by a local bluegrass band and DJs.

*Tickets*: $40 pres​ale available here: [hops-for-housing-2016.eventbrite.com](https://hops-for-housing-2016.eventbrite.com), $40 at the door. All tickets include a souvenir tasting glass to commemorate the event.

The San Francisco Tenants Union is the city’s oldest and largest tenants’ rights advocacy organization. Founded in 1970, the Tenants Union is membership supported and volunteer based. The SFTU helps individual renters deal with problems such as evictions and rent increases at a drop ­in clinic; publishes a Tenants Rights Handbook; and advocates for laws to strengthen rent control and other tenant protections in San Francisco.
