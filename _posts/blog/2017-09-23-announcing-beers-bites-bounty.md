For one night only, Thursday, October 26, Sirwisa Brewing Collective is hosting an evening of food and beer to showcase the results of connecting homebrewers, commercial breweries, and local chefs/restaurants with local farmers. Entrance to the event gets you a commemorative tasting glass, which enables you to taste a diverse selection of food and beer pairings from 18 different stations.

*What's Going On Here?*
Homebrewers and commercial brewers collaborated to design unique, small-batch, farmers-market-inspired beers that will be paired with a small bites created by local chefs.

*Why Are We Doing This?*
The goals were to build relationships between the brewers, farmers, and local restaurants. All proceeds will support CUESA's work to cultivate a healthy food system, from their free kids education programs to their assistance for the next generation of farmers.

*What Led Up to the Event?*
CUESA provided the brewers with a guided tour of the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market to meet with farmers, help build the relationship between them, and allow the brewers to learn more about seasonal ingredients for the small batch beers created just for this event.

*Who Does This Benefit?*
CUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture) is dedicated to cultivating a sustainable food system through the operation of farmers markets and educational programs. It is a nonprofit organization founded in 1994 to educate urban consumers about sustainable agriculture and to create links between urban dwellers and local farmers.

Sirwisa Brewing Collective strives to promote highly skilled and motivated brewers with a common goal of excellence in brewing and to work as a collective to help make the transition into the profession. We will work together to further the love of brewing and by sharing the knowledge of the art.
