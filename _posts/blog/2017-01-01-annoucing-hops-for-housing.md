San Francisco’s Family House and the city’s top home and commercial brewers are teaming up Feb. 16th for a fundraiser during SF Beer Week. The Sirwisa Am-Pro is a twist on traditional Pro-Ams (commercial brewers inviting homebrewers to commercially brew). This year homebrewers invited commercial brewers to homebrew a beer for the event. The event will showcase these small batch collaboration beers from home and commercial brewers. All proceeds will go to Family House to families of children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses by providing physical comfort and emotional support, free from financial concerns.

*Music*: Music will be provided by a local bluegrass band and DJs.

*Tickets*: $40 pres​ale available here: [sirwisa-am-pro-2017.eventbrite.com](https://sirwisa-am-pro-2017.eventbrite.com). All tickets include a souvenir tasting glass to commemorate the event.
