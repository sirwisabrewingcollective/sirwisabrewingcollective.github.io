The San Francisco Tenants Union is the city’s oldest and largest tenants’ rights advocacy organization. Founded in 1970, the Tenants Union is membership supported and volunteer based. The SFTU helps individual renters deal with problems such as evictions and rent increases at a drop ­in clinic; publishes a Tenants Rights Handbook; and advocates for laws to strengthen rent control and other tenant protections in San Francisco.
